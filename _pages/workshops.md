Lessons:

* [Git series](link-to-git)


	* suggestions for upcoming meetings:

		* Git part 3 (25/2):
			- conflicts: how to resolve conflicts? how to avoid them?
			- more on branches: merging, rebasing, squeezing, branching models to avoid conflicts
			- more on archeology: when exactly a line was changed? which commit broke or changed code's functionality?

		* Git part 4 (10/3):
			- collaborative Git: sharing repositories with others, keeping repositories in sync, pull and merge requests, contribute to someone else's project

		* Git part 5 (17/3):
			- discussing typical Git workflows or "Gitathon-style workshop"
